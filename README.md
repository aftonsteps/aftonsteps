ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aftonsteps (full name Afton Coombs). My interests include data visualization, web design, interactive design, and eduation. Iâ€™m currently a student at Georgia Tech, where Iâ€™m specializing in interactive intelligence. I'm also working on research at GT concerned with student opportunities and outcomes. When Iâ€™m not working on software or data, you can often find me practicing my other love (ðŸ‘žðŸ‘žðŸŽµ) on the dance floor or in the studio.

ðŸ’» You can find my website at https://aftoncoombs.com

ðŸŒ± Some of my recent projects:

- I just finished a course in robotics at Georgia Tech.
- I'm currently learning to make games in Unity.
- I'm maintainer of a blog/art project devoted to reviews of strange foods at [snack-rooms.com](https://www.snack-rooms.com].
- I'm the primary author and maintainer of an R package on CRAN. :) It's called {ggalignment} and it makes D&D alignment-style charts.
