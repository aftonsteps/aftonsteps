ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aftonsteps (but my real name is Afton Coombs). Iâ€™m a linguist-turned-data-scientist who dabbles in application development. My interests include data science tooling, data visualization, experimentation, and text analytics. Iâ€™m also a part-time student at Georgia Tech, where Iâ€™m currently researching student opportunities and outcomes. When Iâ€™m not working, you can find me on the dance floor or in the studio. ðŸ‘žðŸŽµ

ðŸ’» You can find my website at https://aftoncoombs.com

ðŸŒ± Some of my recent projects:

- I just finished a course in robotics at Georgia Tech. 
- I'm learning DBT in my free time.
- I'm working on starting up a blog (soon!).
- I got an R package on CRAN. It's called {ggalignment} and it makes D&D alignment-style charts.
