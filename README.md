ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aftonsteps (full name Afton Coombs). Iâ€™m a data scientist, developer, and dancer with an interest in archival technology, digital humanities, and anti-surveillance movement practices. As a dancer, my background is in tap, flatfoot, and house. As a data scientist and developer, I have worked in analytics, experimentation, data visualization, and web development. I most enjoy using these technical skills for artists and educators. My research interests include adversarial designs, modeling of randomness and emergent patterns in art, and equity in higher education. Iâ€™m currently a graduate student at Georgia Tech, where Iâ€™m specializing in interactive intelligence. I'm also working on research at GT concerned with student opportunities and outcomes.

ðŸŒ± Some of my recent projects:

- I just finished a course in video game programming at Georgia Tech.
- I finished a dance residency through [SEED](https://www.piyodaflow.com/seed) where I choreographed a piece using anti-surveillance clothing. 
- I'm maintainer of a blog/art project devoted to reviews of strange foods at [snack-rooms.com](https://www.snack-rooms.com).
- I'm the primary author and maintainer of an R package on CRAN. :) It's called {ggalignment} and it makes D&D alignment-style charts.
